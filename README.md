## üëÄ I‚ÄôM INTERESTED IN ...
   I am currently especially interested in learning new concepts and terms related to this field, understanding how things work, discovering new tricks, and building a solid foundation in general programming 
   basics. I want to explore code editors, technologies used in programming, networks, and technology overall. My goal is to start by mastering a programming language at an advanced level, like Pythonüêç or another. I 
   also want to learn how to start making connections in this field, understand how work is done here through experience, and explore new areas such as web design, cybersecurity, and much more.

## üå± I‚ÄôM CURRENTLY LEARNING ... 
  I am currently learning all the fundamentals in my university studies in subjects like: Programming Fundamentals, where we are starting with C and C++; Mathematics, Logic, Introduction to Engineering, and 
  Physics. Additionally, I am self-studying at home by reading, taking Python courses, and watching many videos on tools I can use and learn. Little by little, I am also improving my English by watching videos, 
  using interfaces in English, and practicing casual conversations.
